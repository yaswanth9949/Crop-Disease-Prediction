# Crop-Disease-Prediction

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Plants and foliage are very susceptible to diseases that affect plant growth, which in turn affects farmers. In order to detect a plant disease at a very early stage, it is beneficial to use
an automatic crop disease prediction technique. Nowadays there are many common diseases affecting leaves such as: B. Bacterial spot, leaf spot, rot, powdery mildew, etc. Manually detecting the disease is a very difficult task. Therefore, it is necessary to develop software methods that make the disease detection and classification process use images of leaves. Overcome this problem to find out if the crop is sick or healthy.



OBJECTIVES 

The following objectives of this project:

1. Developing a good website which we will handle easily to predict diseased images.

2. Have to train and test different crops of leaves and real time images to predict and not form existing dataset.

3. Using of architecture of ReLu, batch Normalization , Convolutional neural network as it activation function using in today’s which we include and see in Algorithm we used.

4. Maintenance of the system is easy.

5. Able to predict all type of input images to check it is diseased or healthy of plant leaf.

6. Have to get good acc uracy of the project.

7. Getting the result of disease should come as fastly.

8. If disease is dete cted it should say crop name, type of disease, how to cure of the disease.

9. Having to try others machine learning models to test it.



CONCLUSION

In summary, ResNet is a deep neural network architecture that is used for image classification tasks. It uses skip connections to help solve the problem of vanishing gradients and can be trained to accurately classify images into different categories. Also we conclude that CDP (Crop Disease Prediction) is useful for farmers to detect the type of disease at starting stage. Also, it is based on technology compare to traditional way to find it lately. Agriculture is decreasing day by day due to loss of crops, investment etc.
