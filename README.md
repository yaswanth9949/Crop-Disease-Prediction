# Crop-Disease-Prediction

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Plants and foliage are very susceptible to diseases that affect plant growth, which in turn affects farmers. In order to detect a plant disease at a very early stage, it is beneficial to use
an automatic crop disease prediction technique. Nowadays there are many common diseases affecting leaves such as: B. Bacterial spot, leaf spot, rot, powdery mildew, etc. Manually detecting the disease is a very difficult task. Therefore, it is necessary to develop software methods that make the disease detection and classification process use images of leaves. Overcome this problem to find out if the crop is sick or healthy.

OBJECTIVES 

The following objectives of this project:

1. Developing a good website which we will handle easily to predict diseased images.

2. Have to train and test different crops of leaves and real time images to pred ict and not for existing dataset.

3. Using of architecture of ReLu, batch Normalization , Convolutional neural network as it activation function using in todayâ€™s which we include and see in Algorithm we used.

4. Maintenance of the system is easy.

5. Able to predict all type of input images to check it is diseased or healthy of plant leaf.

6. Have to get good acc uracy of the project.

7. Getting the result of disease should come as fastly.

8. If disease is dete cted it should say crop name, type of disease, how to cure of the disease.

9. Having to try others machine learning models to test it.
